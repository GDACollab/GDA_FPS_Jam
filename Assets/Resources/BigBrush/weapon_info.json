  "description": "It’s a big paint brush. It’s meant to resemble the Brush class of weapons from the Splatoon series, however its functionality was limited to what I could figure out how to do. It is able to fire out a volley of 3 large projectiles every swing, with each swing being triggered by pressing the fire button.",
